        <h1>Our Story</h1>
        <p>
            Farmhouse Pet Treats was founded in 2019 in the rural town of Yass NSW
            to bring the best Australian-made pet treats to the market at a great
            price. Founder Andrew continues to build the business along with Hanna,
            Niamh, Alivia, and Chloe; building a loyal customer base, and adding new
            high-quality treat lines in response to requests

            Our baked treats are hand-made in Yass NSW; dog cookies, donuts, crazy 
            bones, birthday cakes, and more. We stock a wide range of premium Australian 
            dried meat treats – including beef, camel, chicken, crocodile, fish, 
            kangaroo, lamb, pork, and venison. We have treats for dogs and cats, as 
            well as chickens, horses, rabbits, mice, guinea pigs, and more.

            We’re proud to be growing and employing in our local area, and buying 
            our ingredients as close to Yass as possible to support those surrounding 
            small businesses and communities. Not only do we buy Australian ingredients, 
            we also ensure we are eco-friendly in all our activities.

            Andrew manages a health condition and disability that limits the function 
            of his hands and feet, and is neurodivergent. He remains active in managing 
            the business, producing treats, and selling online and at markets. We’re still 
            based on Andrew’s farm in Yass and have grown to be one of the region’s largest 
            pet treat providers and sellers. We attend many local markets, including the 
            weekly Capital Region Farmers Markets, and have strong online sales nationwide.
