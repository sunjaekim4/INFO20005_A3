      <h1>Our Ethics</h1>
      <h2>Environmental - reducing our pawprint</h2>
      <i>Be the change you want</i>

      <p>
        We care about the environment we live and work in, and are taking steps
        to ensure our impact is as small as possible. We try to be the change we
        want by using:
      </p>

      <table>
        <tr>
          <td>Australian</td>
          <td>
            We pride ourselves on being Australian and using Australian-made and
            -grown inputs wherever possible. This ensures we have higher quality
            control and keeps our dollars and employment here. What’s more, we
            buy from the closest supplier to Yass – this ensures we not only
            limit transportation, we support local producers and communities.
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>Box stuffing</td>
          <td>
            We use bio-friendly packing – either excess newspaper scrunched, or
            Australian-made bio-fill ‘peanuts’ made from Corn Starch, not
            plastic. They dissolve in water leaving no harsh residue, can be
            disposed of in your garbage, or are 100% biodegradable and can be
            composted or added to soil where they’ll improve the soil structure.
            At times we’ll also use air-popped popcorn from corn grown on our
            farm.
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>Box tape</td>
          <td>
            The tape we use to seal our shipping boxes is paper-based with a wet
            gum, making it both compostable and biodegradable.
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>Carbon, ours</td>
          <td>
            We offset our own energy use in baking, office, and transport with
            extensive bushland replanting and regeneration projects on our
            property and in the surrounding region, as well as purchasing
            offsets.
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>Carbon, suppliers</td>
          <td>
            We use ethical and carbon-neutral suppliers wherever possible and
            minimise the ‘product miles’ our products use. We use Australia Post
            as our main shipper, they have a commitment to be carbon-neutral for
            their entire operation, or Fedex/TNT who are working rapidly towards
            being carbon-neutral. Our main supplier of dried treats are
            air-dried in Australia’s most technically advanced, environmentally
            friendly facility with solar cells and a heat bank to supply the
            base load of more than 3,000 kW of pure energy.

          <td>Cling wrap</td>
          <td>
            For the dried products we wrap in-house, we use a recyclable and
            biodegradable cling wrap film free from BPA or PVC.
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>Product bags</td>
          <td>
            We use kraft paper made from recycled materials, with a bio-film
            liner that is compostable and biodegradable.
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>Shipping boxes</td>
          <td>
            We use either Australia Post or our own shipping boxes, and both are
            made from recycled cardboard.
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>Sustainable fish catch</td>
          <td>
            We will not carry any stock from threatened or endangered fish
            species – if we can’t verify the fish species used, we won’t carry
            it. We do not carry any shark product as we’ve unable to verify the
            species caught by the suppliers.
          </td>

        <tr>
          <td>Zip lock bags</td>
          <td>
